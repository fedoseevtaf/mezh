# Rules:

- Only tabs
- No .gitignore in repo

## Indentation policy

You MUST use tabs instead of spaces, because tabs can be rescaled and customised easily.

## .gitignore policy

You SHALL NOT push or even commit .gitignore, but you SHALL use it to protect repo of unexpected info about your work process.
